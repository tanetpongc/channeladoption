## The Long-Term Effects of Online Channel Adoption in Grocery Retailing: A Research Note

#Abstract:
This study explores the long-term effects of online channel adoption on grocery retailing. Employing the theory of shopping utility maximization, we investigate purchase behaviors of existing customers in categories with different online shopping utility and link them to changes in purchase patterns (shopping frequency and monetary value) and ultimately retailer revenues. Using five-year customer data from a Nordic grocery retailer, we compare (multichannel) customers who adopt an online channel with customers who do not by using propensity score matching and difference-in-differences analysis. The findings show that multichannel customers had their purchasing habits disrupted and this led them to change in the long run; they buy more products in categories with high perceived online ordering convenience and fewer products in categories with high perceived ordering risk. Although they do not change their purchase frequency, the monetary value (per visit) increases, leading to higher total expenditure and thus long-term revenue to the retailer. Our research contributes to the existing literature, which has focused on the short-term effects of online adoption in the grocery context by empirically showing the long-term effects on the category level, customer level, and retailer level, and by providing a systematic bottom-up framework for the retailer to study the effects of customer adoption over time.
